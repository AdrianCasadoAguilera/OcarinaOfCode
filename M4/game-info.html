                            <p>Hyrule is the initial map of the game. You will appear upside a rock at the left of the map, and you'll start the journey from here. Move freely at the map to discover it.</p>
                            <p>At Hyrule you can find multiple elements, such as sanctuaries 0 and 1, which will provide you with two extra lifes to enjoy a little more your adventure. You will also be able to open your very first chest, situated at the right of the map. Open it, and fight against two of the initial enemies!</p>

                            <p>Once you enter Hyrule, you will see a big lake next to a little group of stones. It's a fascinating map to explore, with only one sanctuary, but two chests waiting for you.</p>
                            <p>You can also fight against its enemies and train before going to the Castle, and you can enjoy the little forest situated at the central part of Gerudo.</p>

                            <p>Necluda is a beautiful coast zone, with a little lake where you can fish different fishes, but also at the sea at the right of the map. You will appear next to a little mountain that allows you to see an amazing panoramic of the zone.</p>
                            <p>Two sanctuaries and a lot of natural sources awaits for you to prepare for the final fight. Train yourself with the enemies you can find here at Necluda, and enjoy the views before going to the dangreous Death Mountain.</p>

                            <p>Do you like fire? Do you need a difficult and dangreous experience? Don't be sure about that, because when you visit Death Mountain, you will not think like that!</p>
                            <p>Death Mountain is the perfect map to prepare yourself for the final battle against Ganon. Although your first view will see a beautiful lake, forget it, you will not see a single drop of water in all the time you will spend here... If you don't die.</p>

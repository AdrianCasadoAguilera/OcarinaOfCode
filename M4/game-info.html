                            <p>At Hyrule you can find multiple elements, such as sanctuaries 0 and 1, which will provide you with two extra lifes to enjoy a little more your adventure. You will also be able to open your very first chest, situated at the right of the map. Open it, and fight against two of the initial enemies!</p>

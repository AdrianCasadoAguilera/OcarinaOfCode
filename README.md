## About The Project

This GitHub is a school project game that draws inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, recreating elements of its open-world adventure in a personalized game. Utilizing Python, embark on a nostalgic journey featuring expansive landscapes and epic battles. May the spirit of Hyrule guide our development!
Gameplay:
* **Open-World Exploration:** Players can explore a vast and visually stunning open world, discovering shrines, fighting enemies and interacting with diverse environments.
* **Combat:**  Real-time combat with various enemies, utilizing a Sword and a Shield. Each encounter requires strategy and skill to overcome!
* **Cooking:** Make several plates of food to recover your life and fight your enemies!
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
